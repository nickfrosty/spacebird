# Spacebird

The very first public Twitter Spaces search engine. 

Helping the early adopters of Twitter Spaces to explore active and scheduled Twitter spaces.

## The problem

For several months after Twitter released Spaces, their live audio chatroom product, there was no way to search for them. Either active ones or scheduled.

## The goal

Spacebird was created to bridge the gap of what Twitter was seeminly slow to roll out: a way to search and find specific topic based Twitter Spaces.

## Tech stack

- Vue.js - frontend framework
- TailwindCSS - CSS tooling and designing
- Elasticsearch - as a scalable search database to cache the Twitter API calls (to prevent reaching the very low rate limit)
- Node/Express API - RESTful API to communicate between the Twitter API and the Elasticsearch database
